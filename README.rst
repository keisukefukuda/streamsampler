==========================

StreamSampler package allows you to sample a particular number of elements from
a stream of data of which length is very large or unknown.

StreamSampler is provided in both forms of an executable command and library.
It utilizes Reservoir sampling algorithm [`Vitter85`_]

You can take a look at the README.txt of other projects, such as repoze.bfg
(http://bfg.repoze.org/trac/browser/trunk/README.txt) for some ideas.
